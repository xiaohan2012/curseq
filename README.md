# curseq

Sequence annotation tool written in Curses and Python

## Features

- Command-line based & pure keyboard manipulation
- Allowing multiple labeling tasks in parallel(e.g, doing NER and POS together)
- Customisation by creating a self-defined configuration file

## Demo

To be here later

## Customisation

Customisation allows you to define your own set of labels as well as keybindings. 

To do that, make changes to `config.py`. It can be easily understood and mofified.

## Todo

1. More user friendly command line interface for `app.py`
2. A really nice demo
3. Better rendering/contrast for words and labels
